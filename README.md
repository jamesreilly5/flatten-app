# flatten-app

Small repo created for a technical test:

Write a function that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] â†’ [1,2,3,4]. If the language you're using has a function to flatten arrays, you should pretend it doesn't exist.
